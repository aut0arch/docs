# Frontend App

The `app` module is a modern, responsive web application that visualizes the final output of the `aut0arch` system.

## Role
The final output, `clustering_data.json`, contains the entire structural architecture of a Java repository alongside AI-generated functional explanations. The `app` presents this data.

Built on **React**, **Vite**, and **Cytoscape**, the application creates a large interactive graph where nodes represent architectural clusters, and edges represent their flow and dependency.

When a user selects a cluster visually, a dynamic sidebar expands rendering the textual context generated by the `explainer`:
* The purpose of the cluster
* Detected design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Proxy)
* Extracted snippets of code that highlight the model's evidence

## Core Technologies
* `react`: For UI and component state management.
* `cytoscape`: For rendering the mathematical node connections.
* `cytoscape-dagre`: For automatically organizing the nodes using hierarchical layout algorithms.
